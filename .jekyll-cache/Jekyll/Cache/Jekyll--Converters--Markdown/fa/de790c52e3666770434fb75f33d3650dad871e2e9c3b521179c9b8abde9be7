<p>As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with the open web, and everything in between leading to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and the wonderful team who wrangled that Ruby in our favor. The theme stylesheets are built on top of <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">Lanyon</a>, a Jekyll theme based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, ‚Äúthe Jekyll butler,‚Äù both created by <a href="https://github.com/mdo">Mark Otto</a> and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks, Mark, for your helpful streamlining! Special hat tips to brother-in-markdown-arms, <a href="https://github.com/c-forster">Chris Forster</a>, and the generous <a href="https://github.com/inukshuk/">Sylvester Keil</a> for his work on Jekyll Scholar.</p>
